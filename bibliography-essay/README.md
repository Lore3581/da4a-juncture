## Interdisciplinarity in Data Science Pedagogy: A Foundational Design

This article demonstrates that an interdisciplinary approach to teaching data science can be effective — as shown through the case study of creating an “introduction to data science” course at a mid-western regional university. <br><br>While these courses were taught across the Management Information Systems and Computer Science fields, this paper has some interesting information about how they structured the course and assessments about how the students rated their learning experiences. It also includes a literature review that discusses previous scholarship in interdisciplinary pedagogy.[^1]

## A Data Science Course for Undergraduates: Thinking With Data

This article, published in 2015, reviews an experimental undergraduate course that served as an introduction to data science. One notable difference is that this course required prerequisites including an introductory statistics course and some prior programming experience. That aside, it includes information about what was shared on the first day of class, how topics such as data visualization were taught, and notes on computing and assignments. [^2]

## Designing Tools and Activities for Data Literacy Learners

This article discusses how several tools used to encourage and explore data-centric thinking have been created for data users and not data learners—so it explores the tools currently available in the data literacy space, advocating for the tool selected to be strongly focused, well guided, very inviting, and highly expandable. It also discusses practical applications in a case study.[^3]

## The Data Storytelling Workbook

This book includes an introduction and five chapters: 1. A Narrative Approach to Data Storytelling, 2. Navigating Data's Unequal Terrain, 3. Visual Data Storytelling, 4. Data Storytelling with Maps, and 5. Future-Proof Principles. According to the description, it combines real-life scenarios with critical reflection and creative solutions in the data storytelling process — while also taking into consideration the ethics of visualizing difficult subjects.

## Teaching Data Visualization and Storytelling with Data Comic Workshops

This paper proposes a methodology for teaching data comic workshops, which combines three aspects of data comics (data, visualization, and stories) to provide an alternative way for students to engage and communicate using data. [^5]
