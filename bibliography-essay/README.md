## Interdisciplinarity in Data Science Pedagogy: A Foundational Design

This article demonstrates that an interdisciplinary approach to teaching data science can be effective — as shown through the case study of creating an “introduction to data science” course at a mid-western regional university. <br><br>While these courses were taught across the Management Information Systems and Computer Science fields, this paper has some interesting information about how they structured the course and assessments about how the students rated their learning experiences. It also includes a literature review that discusses previous scholarship in interdisciplinary pedagogy.[^1]

## Designing Tools and Activities for Data Literacy Learners

This article discusses how several tools used to encourage and explore data-centric thinking have been created for data users and not data learners—so it explores the tools currently available in the data literacy space, advocating for the tool selected to be strongly focused, well guided, very inviting, and highly expandable. It also discusses practical applications in a case study.[^3]

## The Data Storytelling Workbook

This book includes an introduction and five chapters: 1. A Narrative Approach to Data Storytelling, 2. Navigating Data's Unequal Terrain, 3. Visual Data Storytelling, 4. Data Storytelling with Maps, and 5. Future-Proof Principles. According to the description, it combines real-life scenarios with critical reflection and creative solutions in the data storytelling process — while also taking into consideration the ethics of visualizing difficult subjects.

## Sample Audio File

This is an experiment to see if an audio file will work with Juncture. The audio file comes from a different project Lore put togehter for this semester, The Stories We (Re)Tell at https://www.storiesweretell.com/.

# Sample Data Embedding

After being asked about data manipulation possibilities within the site, I wanted to test to see if a Google Sheets spreadsheet could allow for indivdiuals to experiment with and modify data... but implications of potential vandalism should be considered and explored.
