## Interdisciplinarity in Data Science Pedagogy: A Foundational Design

This article demonstrates that an interdisciplinary approach to teaching data science can be effective — as shown through the case study of creating an “introduction to data science” course at a mid-western regional university. 

While these courses were taught across the Management Information Systems and Computer Science fields, this paper has some interesting information about how they structured the course and assessments about how the students rated their learning experiences. It also includes a literature review that discusses previous scholarship in interdisciplinary pedagogy.[^1]

## A Data Science Course for Undergraduates: Thinking With Data

This article, published in 2015, reviews an experimental undergraduate course that served as an introduction to data science. One notable difference is that this course required prerequisites including an introductory statistics course and some prior programming experience. That aside, it includes information about what was shared on the first day of class, how topics such as data visualization were taught, and notes on computing and assignments. [^2]
